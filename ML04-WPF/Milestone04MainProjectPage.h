/// \section intro TMS Program Introduction
/// The <b>Omnicorp Corporation TMS: Transportation Management System</b> is a application representation, handling the needs of a cargo transport system,
/// The <i>TMS</i> system will handle the logistical data required for Customers to place shipping Orders, which are then
/// processed using the derived database information, to result in the most expedient and cost-efficient solution to the request.
/// This <i>dOxyGen Wiki</i> outlines the framework of the project.
///
///
/// There are <b>two main Groups</b> that make up the system usage and application workings:
/// 
/// Major <i>TMS</i> Users of the application are:
/// 
/// - The <b>Buyer</b>, who represents the customer looking to place an Order.
/// - The <b>Planner</b>, who handles the customer requests and derives the necessary data required.
/// - The <b>Admin</b>, who oversees the functionality and stability of the system components.
/// 
/// /// Major <i>TMS</i> Components of the application are:
/// 
/// - The <b>Data/Logic Controller</b>, which represents the logistical overseer of the data stored and retrieved.
/// - The <b>User Interface</b>, which is the GUI used by the three <i>Users</i>, interfacing with the application.
/// - The <b>Communications</b>, which acts as the conduit to access external Carrier and Contract Marketplace information.
/// - The <b>mySQL</b>, which is the database storage, housing all the required information, to be retrieved for Order requirements.
